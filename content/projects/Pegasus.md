PRO stands for Patient Reported Outcome. The module presents aggregated data of the recorded responses using various graphs, charts, and grids. While leading the UI team, Define code practices to build a decoupled code-base minimizing code smells. I handle the front end and a couple of microservices working on NodeJS, GraphQL & MongoDB.
